Mention **@Linear** in any Microsoft Teams channel to turn your conversations into actionable work.

You can ask Linear to make changes directly in Linear, or pull information from Linear into Teams. Try it by sending a message like:

- **@Linear** file a bug for this and assign it to me
- **@Linear** what’s the latest progress on our billing API project?
- **@Linear** create issues for each feature request mentioned in this video

### [Keep everyone up to date on progress⁠](https://linear.app/changelog\#keep-everyone-up-to-date-on-progress)

Connect your Linear projects to Teams channels to keep everyone aligned. After connecting, project notifications like updates will automatically post to Teams.

![project update in Teams showing progress since march 19th, with a description of changes in the core performance project. ](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/de21aba5590c771b7e55e6ac87c43447275a38c6-3600x1920.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

Install Linear for Microsoft Teams in [settings](https://linear.app/settings/integrations/microsoft-teams), or learn more in our [documentation](https://linear.app/integrations/microsoft-teams).

## [Custom coding tool integrations⁠](https://linear.app/changelog\#custom-coding-tool-integrations)

Linear already supports [one-click integrations](https://linear.app/changelog/2026-02-26-deeplink-to-ai-coding-tools) to open issues in popular tools like Claude Code, Codex and Cursor. To better support custom workflows and new tools, we’ve added support for custom coding tool integrations.

Custom coding tool integrations let you open issues in tools that aren’t supported out of the box. You can configure them in two ways:

- Launch a tool using a URL with query parameters
- Run a local command from the desktop app

Add a new custom coding tool in [preferences](https://linear.app/settings/account/preferences/coding-tools), or learn more in our [documentation](https://linear.app/docs/assigning-issues#open-issues-in-coding-tools).

## [Sync multiple Slack threads to an issue⁠](https://linear.app/changelog\#sync-multiple-slack-threads-to-an-issue)

When an issue is reported in Slack, either through Asks or the Linear Agent, a synced thread is added to that issue to enable follow-up communication.

Now you can sync an issue to multiple Slack threads when there are multiple reports or requests for the same issue. When the issue is completed, every synced thread receives an update with the outcome.

Connect a new Slack thread to an issue by mentioning **@Linear** or using the “Link to existing issue” option in the Slack integration.

[**Multi-level sub-teams**](https://linear.app/changelog/2026-04-09-multi-level-sub-teams)

![Cascading sub-teams that read: Engineering, Infra, Mobile, Android, iOS](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/c54265ffc54572c43a25fbd75d64be26222d0b29-3600x1800.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

Structure your teams in Linear to match how your organization works.

Teams can nest up to five levels deep, making it possible to represent divisions, departments, groups, squads, and more. Sub-teams inherit workflows and settings from their parents at every level, so you can maintain consistency while giving each unit flexibility in how they work.

Multi-level sub-teams are available on the Enterprise plan. Learn more in our [docs](https://linear.app/docs/sub-teams).

## [Project and initiative comments⁠](https://linear.app/changelog\#project-and-initiative-comments)

Projects and initiatives now support comments in their activity feed, giving teams a place for high-level discussion alongside updates. Conversations stay attached to the work itself, making it easier for both people and agents to follow and reference.

![Comment thread on a project: what direction should we take for the first version, I'd go with the simpler path first and learn from real usage, Yeah we can always add depth later, but the core flow should be obvious now, Ship the simpler version first](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/8ea3eb8ff10d0e1340e9acc8ad9e021c8d7f3f94-3600x2058.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

Use comments to:

- provide lightweight feedback that doesn’t belong in an inline comment or formal update

[**Web forms for Linear Asks**](https://linear.app/changelog/2026-04-02-web-forms-for-linear-asks)

![Hero image showing web connecting to Asks connecting to Linear](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/7947ca43dbce4368c7e039537cf1ba7c0f4ca3a9-3600x1800.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

[Linear Asks](https://linear.app/asks) allows you to capture internal requests and bring them into Linear so the appropriate team can work on them. Previously, we’ve enabled intake through Slack and email.

Now we’ve added custom web forms as well.

Teams can create a dedicated Asks page with forms for the types of requests they handle, like feature requests, bug reports, data pulls, or HR and IT tasks. Forms are powered by issue templates, so teams control exactly what information gets collected. Every submission becomes an issue in the team’s triage inbox, where it can be fielded by a team member or routed with [Triage Intelligence](https://linear.app/docs/triage-intelligence).

Anyone in your company can create an ask, even if they don’t have a Linear account. After submitting an ask, submitters can follow up through a synced email thread on the issue.

![laptop request web form ](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/c72160def314dd9ba1730a91cb95aee4f5da5f08-3600x2400.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

[Try Linear Agent](https://linear.app/agent)

_We’re excited to share the next major step in Linear’s evolution. For the vision behind Linear Agent, read [the letter from our CEO, Karri](https://linear.app/next)._

As execution accelerates, the bottleneck in product development shifts toward judgment: deciding exactly what to build and where your team’s time, attention, and tokens are best spent.

Your workspace already contains much of the context needed to drive good product decisions, but getting to it means reading through threads, combing the backlog, reviewing customer requests, and piecing together what’s relevant.

Linear Agent brings all of that context within reach.

Built directly into Linear, and accessible everywhere, Linear Agent understands your roadmap, issues, and code. It can help you synthesize context, make recommendations, and take action.

![Inline agent session examples, creating issues from an uploaded video](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/7fc0d29a391b03f9e66c2c785c8b6e98b49dd3ef-3600x2560.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

For example, when starting a new project, instead of manually researching past feature requests, you can ask Linear to find related issues, group them by relevance, and pull the right ones in. From there, ask it to extract common requirements across customer requests and scope out a starting point for your spec — all in a few minutes.

Linear Agent is powered by frontier language models and fully grounded in the context of your workspace. Use it to supercharge your everyday workflows:

- In Slack, send: _“@Linear_ _Make issues based on the discussion here and assign them to me”_
- When writing a project update, tell it: _“I’m writing an update for this project. What’s changed recently, and what should I include?”_
- When planning your next cycle: _“Read this backlog and pull out repeated themes that we can prioritize”_
- When you come back from time off and need to know what’s going on: _“Is anything at risk or falling behind that I should be aware of?”_

Linear Agent works with you wherever you are. Open a chat from the bottom-right of the desktop app (shortcut `Cmd/Ctrl + J`) or the mobile app, or mention `@Linear` in any comment or reply. It’s also available in [Slack](https://linear.app/docs/slack#linear-agent-for-slack) and [Microsoft Teams](https://marketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/product/WA200010301?tab=Overview).

## [Skills and Automations⁠](https://linear.app/changelog\#skills-and-automations)

As you use Linear Agent, you’ll find workflows worth repeating. When a conversation gets you to a good result, you can ask Linear to save it as a reusable skill. This is especially useful for recurring workflows, like catching up on projects or drafting issues from meeting notes. Run a skill from the skills menu in any chat or with a slash command. Linear will also automatically use skills when it thinks they are applicable.

![Skill loaded in agent chat by pressing / and selecting "Split into sub-issues" skill](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/be942ac7b04dbbe2a45b02838852f495c237cd51-3600x1920.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

You can also trigger agent workflows automatically when issues enter triage. Every new issue adds context to your workspace, and Linear can intelligently help you refine, synthesize, or act on it.

Automations are available on Business and Enterprise plans.

![Customer context automation adding a summary of customer impact to the issue entering triage](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/fc989a7efb1e16a5ac8aca92c4ac1502fcad3fc1-3600x1982.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## [Code Intelligence (coming soon)⁠](https://linear.app/changelog\#code-intelligence-(coming-soon))

We’re also announcing Code Intelligence, a capability that extends Linear Agent’s understanding to your codebase. Once enabled, it supports code-aware tasks like diagnosing app functionality and designing technical specifications.

Non-technical teammates can ask questions they’d normally have to track down an engineer to answer — how a feature works, who owns a system, what recently changed — and get a reliable response.

Code Intelligence is coming soon to Business and Enterprise plans.

![Agent chat open, user asking a question about their codebase -- how does the payments service handle failed transactions?](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/0708264e2d939cd6bc059a8909283f86c18d7abc-3600x1920.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## [Availability and pricing⁠](https://linear.app/changelog\#availability-and-pricing)

Linear Agent is now available in **public beta** for all teams. Agent and Skills are included on all Linear plans. Automations and Code Intelligence are available on Business and Enterprise.

During the beta period, all features are available at no additional cost as we refine and expand the product.

At general availability, we expect chat functionality — in-app, in comments, Slack, and Microsoft Teams — to remain included in the base seat price. High-volume compute capabilities like Automations and Code Intelligence may move to usage-based pricing beyond a certain threshold.

We’ll provide clear advance notice before any pricing changes take effect. [Reach out](https://linear.app/contact) if you have any questions.

[**UI refresh**](https://linear.app/changelog/2026-03-12-ui-refresh)

![Redesign hero image showing new icon styles](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/696c7f2b0921b5e3163710ea1b310dfb8e4e377c-3600x2080.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

Introducing a calmer, more consistent interface.

We’ve visually refreshed Linear’s interface design to make it easier to scan information, navigate between workflows, and stay focused.

A few highlights:

- Headers, navigation, and view controls are now consistent across projects, issues, reviews, and documents, making it simpler to orient yourself and move between workflows
- Icons across the app have been redrawn and resized
- Navigation sidebars are slightly dimmer, allowing the main content area to stand out

Learn more about our design process on our [blog](https://linear.app/now/behind-the-latest-design-refresh).

## [Additional launchers for AI coding tools⁠](https://linear.app/changelog\#additional-launchers-for-ai-coding-tools)

We recently gave you the ability to open issues directly in your [AI coding tools](https://linear.app/changelog/2026-02-26-deeplink-to-ai-coding-tools) with all of the context they need to take a first pass.

We’ve now expanded the list of supported tools. In addition to popular options like Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex desktop, you can also now open issues in:

- Amp
- Codex CLI
- Devin
- Factory
- Lovable
- Netlify Agent Runners
- Warp

## [Mobile agent sessions⁠](https://linear.app/changelog\#mobile-agent-sessions)

Work with your coding agents on the go. After delegating an issue to an agent, open its session in the Linear mobile app to see realtime reasoning or review past sessions. For agents that support it, you can also send additional messages in the session to help steer the work.

## [Multiple parents for sub-initiatives⁠](https://linear.app/changelog\#multiple-parents-for-sub-initiatives)

Sometimes a sub-initiative contributes to multiple high-level goals. This is common in goal setting frameworks like OKRs.

Sub-initiatives can now belong to multiple parent initiatives in Linear, allowing you to express how work rolls up in different ways across your org.

Available on [Enterprise](https://linear.app/pricing) plans.

## [Send comment on `Enter` preference⁠](https://linear.app/changelog\#send-comment-on-enter-preference)

Starting an issue used to mean manually creating a feature branch. Now it means assembling the right context so your coding agent can take a first pass. We’ve made this much easier to do in Linear.

You can now launch your preferred coding tool directly from a Linear issue, with a prefilled prompt that includes the issue ID and all relevant context: description, comments, updates, linked references, and images. No copying or reformatting required.

Open in a coding tool by pressing `Cmd`  `Option` `.` (Mac) or `Ctrl`  `Alt` `.`(Windows/Linux) to launch your most recently used tool, `W` then `O` to choose from your enabled tools, or by clicking the button next to the issue identifier.

Supported tools:

- Claude Code
- Codex
- Conductor
- Cursor
- GitHub Copilot
- OpenCode
- Replit
- v0
- Zed

Prompt templates can also be customized to add standing instructions for how your agent should approach issues. For example, you may always want your agent to give you a detailed plan before writing any code.

![Screenshot of a dark-themed UI modal titled “Prompt template.” The description reads: “The template to use when opening an issue in a coding tool, or when copying an issue as a prompt. Use {{issue.identifier}} or {{context}} to insert dynamic values.” Below, a bordered text box contains the template:  “You are working on {{issue.identifier}}.  {{context}}  Treat issue comments as part of the spec. If comments contradict the description, ask me before proceeding.  Keep changes scoped to the issue. If you notice something unrelated, add a comment rather than fixing it.  After implementing, outline what tests need to be written before considering the task complete.  If anything is underspecified, ask me before implementing.”](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/be2f8f96ba367ed2fb23f7cfbbc499fe9a7e8bfc-3600x1988.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

[**Advanced filters and share issues in private teams**](https://linear.app/changelog/2026-02-13-advanced-filters-and-share-issues-in-private-teams)

![Abstract filter graphic, blurred on left side and wide, to a defined point on the right](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/3c1276b995a06c453e9170248239448b5c1eac30-3600x2080.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

Refine your searches, views, and dashboards with advanced filters. Combine multiple `AND`/`OR` conditions to define exactly what you want to see.

For example, track high-priority bugs for prospective customers in a single view by combining `Priority`, `Label`, and `Customer status` filters.

[Subscribe](https://linear.app/docs/custom-views#issue-view-subscriptions) to a view to get notified when issues match your conditions, or use advanced filters to power targeted dashboards.

Get started by choosing _advanced filter_ from the filter menu, or use _AI filter_ to describe what you’re looking for in natural language.

![Shows advanced filter group defining an or condition](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/76a0de66dd1198cee29f081030c7437c78098d41-3600x1434.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## [Share issues from private teams⁠](https://linear.app/changelog\#share-issues-from-private-teams)

You can now share individual issues from private teams with specific users outside of the team. This is especially useful when bringing collaborators on to solve individual problems for highly sensitive teams, like security or HR. You can assign them a specific issue from your team without giving them access to the rest of the team’s data.

Shared issues will have a banner prominently displayed to indicate who that issue is visible to.

Private issue sharing is available on Enterprise plans. Learn more in our [docs](https://linear.app/docs/private-teams#share-issues-from-a-private-team).

## [Deprecation of `/sse` MCP endpoint⁠](https://linear.app/changelog\#deprecation-of-sse-mcp-endpoint)

SSE as a transport was deprecated starting with protocol version `2024-11-05`. As all modern clients now support the more reliable HTTP streams, Linear MCP is fully removing SSE support. To switch, update your endpoint from `https://mcp.linear.app/sse` to `https://mcp.linear.app/mcp`.

Deprecation errors for SSE will be rolled out gradually over the next two months.

Read more in [Linear MCP documentation](https://linear.app/docs/mcp).

## [Nested sub-issues⁠](https://linear.app/changelog\#nested-sub-issues)

Issue lists can now show sub-issues as a nested hierarchy. Turn on this display option from any issue list view.

![A nested list of issues in Linear showing progress on improving iOS app startup performance, with statuses, assignees, and completion dates.](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/e9278628833a0b32b8b8607fb0e0a5838aa27a96-3600x2136.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## [Retired teams⁠](https://linear.app/changelog\#retired-teams)

Teams form and disband as organizations evolve. When a team is no longer active, its issues and projects still hold useful context, but shouldn’t clutter your workspace.

We’re introducing the ability to retire teams, giving you a clean way to wind a team down while preserving its project and issue history.

![A confirmation dialog in Linear showing the impact of retiring a team, including canceled issues, read-only projects, and disabled cycles, with Cancel and Retire team buttons.](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/7bad8b08be03d104e8291ac363a347844d09f822-3600x1770.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

Retired teams are read-only and hidden from the sidebar, but their issues, projects, and documents are still accessible. When retiring a team, you can choose to cancel any remaining open issues or move them to another team. Retired teams can be restored at any time.

Admins, workspace owners, and team owners can retire a team from its settings page.

[**Time in status**](https://linear.app/changelog/2026-01-29-time-in-status)

![a screenshot of the time in status UI](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/e3d311d10fbbce382a9142fd6dab1a25198b3023-3600x2080.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

Time spent in individual statuses is now tracked and available throughout Linear. Hover over any issue’s status indicator to see the cumulative time it’s spent in each status. You can use this to spot where things are getting stuck, identify bottlenecks, and optimize your development process.

On lists and boards, you can see how long items have been in their current status. Order by `time in status` to surface blocked work, or filter by conditions like `In Review > 7 days` to catch issues that have fallen through the cracks.

In Insights and Dashboards, analyze the time spent in any status and slice by time period or other attributes to see how performance changes and differs across your workspace. Use this to quickly uncover systemic bottlenecks and outliers.

![A screenshot of time in status in the Insights panel](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/11a1b1a2e88cb42d8567c3f7ecc0f148e75e8768-3600x2328.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

Time in status is available as a [display option](https://linear.app/docs/display-options) in views, and as a new measure in [Insights](https://linear.app/docs/insights).

## [Jira Epic sync⁠](https://linear.app/changelog\#jira-epic-sync)

We’ve upgraded our [Jira](https://linear.app/integrations/jira) integration to support bi-directional syncing between Jira Epics and Linear projects. Changes to properties like status, target date, and description automatically reflect in both applications, so you don’t have to update them manually.

Configure the Jira integration from your Linear workspace’s [integration settings](https://linear.app/settings/integrations/jira).

Now you can customize Linear Mobile to fit your daily workflow.

Personalize the bottom toolbar to prioritize the features you use the most. Rearrange the main navigation items, or pin specific projects, initiatives, and documents for quick access. For example, you can choose Pulse to stay up to date with work across your teams, or My issues to manage your assigned tasks.

![Linear mobile app showing the “Pinned” menu, with Inbox, Pulse, and Initiatives pinned at the top, plus Edit and Close buttons.](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/69d970eccd5514ebee12553d36414f9b4f23366c-3600x2360.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

To pin specific projects, initiatives, or documents, open the item and use the **•••** menu in the top-right.

![Linear mobile project screen with an options menu open, showing actions like Favorite, Pin to tab bar, Copy link, Edit project, and Delete project.](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/43ff5cb87d743e2a5bce4f21c5c399778832cf4d-3600x2360.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## [Redesigned timing charts in Insights and Dashboards⁠](https://linear.app/changelog\#redesigned-timing-charts-in-insights-and-dashboards)

Timing charts in Insights and Dashboards have been redesigned to make it easier to spot workflow trends and bottlenecks.

Timing charts now use a logarithmic scale by default so outliers don’t visually flatten the rest of your data. Percentile metrics also display by slice, allowing you to compare across different dimensions or track changes over time. We’ve also removed issue limits to support analysis across much larger datasets.

![Timing chart in Insights depicting lead time over different priority issues](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/a3c6bbbbb787e1f04ae724e8c2e0a5d1e00934be-3600x1970.png?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)
