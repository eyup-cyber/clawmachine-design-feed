## Requirements

This theme relies on the following:

1. **[Card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod)**: **REQUIRED** - Many of the theme's visual effects and custom styling are implemented through card-mod. Without this, the theme will not display correctly.

2. **[HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)](https://hacs.xyz/)**: Recommended for easy installation of card-mod and other custom components.

3. **"Share Tech Mono" font**: For the authentic terminal look. While not strictly required, the theme looks best with this font installed.

## Overview

This theme transforms your Home Assistant interface into a Pipboy-like terminal from the Fallout game series. It features:

- Classic green-on-black color scheme with amber/gold accents
- Retro terminal-style typography using "Share Tech Mono" font
- Animated scan lines and CRT flicker effects
- Glowing elements and terminal-style UI components
- Custom styling for cards, sidebar, buttons, and form fields
